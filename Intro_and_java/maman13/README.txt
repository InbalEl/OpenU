Solution to Maman 13: Airport assignment (based on the previous maman and using its Time1 and Flight APIs).

For convenience, Time1 and Flight are here as well.

In addition, first attempt at writing a Junit test.

- Compile all core files:
$ javac Time1.java
$ javac Flight.java
$ javac Airport.java

- Compile and run test in your favorite framework.
I'm still working on running tests in VSCODE without a build tool.

Enjoy
